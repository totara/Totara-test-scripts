Some ideas for new scripts:

* push/pop - same as save/load but with a stack
* modconf - modify one or more params in the config only
* test - setup unit tests and run them
* adddata - add auto generated data of specific type to current install (based on config)
* upgrade - cliupgrade current site (with optional initial db to use instead of current using load)
